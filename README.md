# Welcome to my website!

Built with HTMl, CSS, JS and incorporating Jquery + Bootstrap libraries so far. This will be my personal portfolio project.
I'm glad to be able to display my interest in the intersection between mathematics, computer science, and business!

Please note: This project is still under construction (started April 2021)...
